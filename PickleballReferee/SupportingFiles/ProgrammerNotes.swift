 TODO Items
 1. Single game to 15 points. Change sides after 8 points to one team.
 2. In best 3 of 5 games, set timeouts to 3.
 3. If single game, how many timeouts are there? Don't see in rules. My guess is 1.
 4. If game to 21 points, how to handle when goes past 21 to win by 2 points. What to display. Ponibnts end at 21.

 Change of side by teams during match. In the third or fifth game
 of such matches the teams change sides halfway through the game.
 
 A triangle mark is placed on the scoresheet of 3rd or 5th games of a
 match to indicate that the teams change sides after a team scores that
 point in the game. Example: If mark is at point 6, then change sides
 after the point where one team scores 6. Players have 1 minute to change sides.
 
 End-Change Marks
 AT 6 of the third game for 3 games to 11 points
 At 8 of the third game for 3 games to 15 points
 AT 11 of the third game for 3 games to 21 points
 
 Before match begins each team designates who will be the first server for the team
 The first server for each team wears an identifying wristband designating that they
 are the first server for their team.
 
 Which team serves first is determined at the pre-Match briefing. The referee determines
 which team "wins the coin toss" using a "secret" number (1 or 2) written on the back of
 his scorsheet. The winning team then decides to either serve, receive, or chose a side of
 the court. The other team then decides whatver is left. For instance if the winning team
 decides to serve, then the other team decides which side of the court to defend and receives.
 As a result we don't know whihe player will be the first server of the match, the first server
 for each team, or which side of the court the teams will be on until after the pre_match briefing.
 
 Thus, the layout of the scoresheet (whether the arrow points left or right) and the identification
 of values for first servers can't be set until after the pre-Match briefing. Plus the layout depends
 on which side of the court the referee stands.
 
 In doubles, teams may change the starting server between games and should notify the referee.
 Teams switch ends and initial service upon the completion of each game.
 In game three of five, the teams will switch ends when the first team reaches a score of 6 / 8 / 11
